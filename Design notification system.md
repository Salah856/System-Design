## The main requirements: 

- Push notification, SMS message, and email.
- Soft real-time system. 
- Notifications can be triggered by client applications. They can also be scheduled on the server-side.
- 10 million mobile push notifications, 1 million SMS messages, and 5 million emails.


### Contact info gathering flow

To send notifications, we need to gather mobile device tokens, phone numbers, or email addresses. When a user installs our app or signs up for the first time, API servers collect user contact info and store it in the database.
